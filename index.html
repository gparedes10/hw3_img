
<h1> Biography</h1>
<p>
    My name is German Paredes. I have been writting code since high school, and have worked with Python, R, SQL, HTML, and CSS. <br>
    I completed my Bacherlor's in 2022 in Info. Systems with a track on Interface Design (UX/UI design), but I have been working in the data science field since 2021.<br>
    I like drawing (although I have not done it in a while), reading, and playing video games. <br>
    This is probably the last drawing I did back when I was in college. It is the character Dark Willow from Dota2.
